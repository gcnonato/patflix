		<h1>Suggested Videos</h1>
		<p>This is a collection of videos that I love watching and recommend many of my friends to see. Many of these videos are thought-provoking, inspiring, or educational, and I hope they connect with you in a similar fashion as they did with me.</p>
		<p>Everything you see below this section was dynamically generated by JavaScript that I wrote from scratch- no jQuery, no plugins, no copy-paste. It uses a static JSON file as the source for all video information, and the sections are dynamically generated based on category tags that the videos contain. (A function takes a category as a parameter, searches the JSON for videos that fall under the category, and then adds them to an Array of objects). The JavaScript builds the elements and then appends them to the DOM. The Carousel animations were also created via vanilla JS and CSS animations, which is why they are so simpleâ€“ they do not use a library. I wouldn't consider this an "Application", because my only intention for this page was to showcase some videos I think are worth sharing, not build something cool (but I couldn't help myself to make this all dynamically created via JS!).</p>
